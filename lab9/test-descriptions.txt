test1
    Part 1 run with empty text file
    Part 2 run with only one Paintball
    Part 3 run with only one Cow
    Part 4 run program without argument
    Part 5 run program with wrong argument(Non existing file)
    Part 6 run program with float values
    Note: Since the description of the assignment says its contents are guaranteed to all be valid, We should
    not check the program for non numerical values.
    Output will be similar to the example given in the assignment:
    Results
    Triggering the RED paint ball is the best choice with 4 total paint on the cow
    Milka's colors: { 'RED' ,'GREEN' }
    Daisy's colors: { 'RED' }
    Fauntleroy's colors: {}
    Babe's colors: { 'BLUE' }

test2
1. No cow is in the range on any paintball so no cow should be painted, else logical implementation of result
    functionality is wrong.
2. All Paintball should trigger each other. Check the implementation of the recursive method: triggering,

test3
1. As Assignment description says program should display "which starting paint ball color painted the cows the most".
   in this test "special" paints two cows: c1 and c2. On the other hand, "bull" gets painted by 3 paints Blue Black Pink
   Though special paintball paints maximum number of cows(2),Now result should be either Black Blue or Pink but
   should not be special.
2. Check boundary condition cows c1 c2 c3 has been placed on the far most possible points in the range of 'special'
   hence the implementation of distance functionality is wrong.
3. Paint ball Blue Black and Pink all are in range of each other hence It also test if two paint ball are connected to
   each other then implementation of the recursion in trigger method should be correct else infinity loop may be
   detected by this test case.
